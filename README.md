# Audio helper tool

Kernmodule GameDev 2
Made by Marlon Sijnesael

This tool provides an easier way for non programmers to incorporate sound into their projects. It's as simple as a press on a button (it is, after you have provided the xml file).
Just fill in the XML template and put it in the Resources folder together with your audio clips and press create!

Complete project and unity package are amongst the files.
